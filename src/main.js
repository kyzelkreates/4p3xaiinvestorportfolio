The /api/textbee-lead.js route reads TEXTBEE_API_KEY, TEXTBEE_DEVICE_ID, and TEXTBEE_RECIPIENT server-side — these credentials are never exposed in frontend code.

Using AI-assisted development workflows and deep modular systems thinking, Ciaran turned complex internal system ideas into live deployed products. Kyzel Clarity™ was also built as a communication bridge to explain complex architectures clearly.' },

Live Mode runs the product for real users. The switch is controlled: add a backend (Supabase, Firebase, or REST API), configure authentication, enable persistent data storage, and the same frontend becomes a fully operational live product.' },

Each is live, installable, and backend-ready.' },

The portfolio itself is the proof — 11 live deployed product demos from one base architecture. No paying customers or revenue are currently claimed.' },
      { test: /architectur|diagram|how.*(built|made|work)|structure|technical/i, reply: 'The architecture follows: one reusable 4P3X base → controlled sector refactor → deployed demo/live product → backend-connected operational platform. The control dashboard communicates with a backend API/DB, which syncs to the user-facing PWA in real time once live. The 4P3X Intelligent AI™ layer adds bounded agents on top of this infrastructure.' },
      { test: /timeline|v1|v2|v3|v4|v5|v6|evolution|version/i, reply: 'The 4P3X Verse™ evolution goes: V1 (1 base, fully deployed) → V2 (5 bases, early deployment) → V3 (10 bases, late development) → V4 (20 bases, early development) → V5 (50 bases, early development) → V6 (100 bases, concept stage). Each version multiplies the modular infrastructure capacity.' },
      { test: /pwa|install|app|offline/i, reply: 'Every 4P3X Verse™ product is designed as an installable PWA. After first load, the core shell works offline. Investors can install this portfolio as a device app for offline review, then reconnect to open live demos and submit contact interest.' },
      { test: /business.?plan|revenue|commerc|model/i, reply: 'Revenue pathways include: paid prototype builds, live product conversion, licensing/white label, SaaS subscriptions after backend integration, grant-funded pilots, consultancy/build contracts, and employment/contract work. The business plan section covers executive summary, problem, solution, target customers, roadmap, risk controls, and investor ask.' },
      { test: /clarity|explain|communicate|knowledge/i, reply: 'Kyzel Clarity™ is an installable AI-powered PWA that acts as a project explainer, knowledge assistant, and communication bridge. Its knowledge base can be swapped to cover any subject, product, or sector — making the same structure reusable as an AI assistant for any organisation.' },
      { test: /55|five base|5 base|product direction|directions/i, reply: 'The 55 product directions come from 5 reusable base systems, each capable of producing 11 sector-ready product variants. Base 1 covers Dashboard + PWA coordination (11 directions), Base 2 covers Training + LMS (11 directions), Base 3 covers Support + Recovery + Care (11 directions), Base 4 covers Compliance + Audit + Trust (11 directions), and Base 5 covers Portfolio + AI Agent + Business Intelligence (11 directions). That gives 55 direct product possibilities from 5 reusable architectures.' },
      { test: /combin|bespoke|recombine|cross.?base|mix/i, reply: 'The true commercial opportunity goes beyond the 55 direct product directions. With 5 base systems, the strongest modules from each can be combined: the dashboard logic from one base, the PWA workflow from another, the compliance layer from another, the training engine from another, and the AI agent or reporting layer from another. This creates thousands of possible bespoke client-specific platforms — supporting SaaS products, white-label systems, grant-ready platforms, client builds, and sector-specific operational systems.' },
      { test: /platform.?factor|modular.?factor|product.?factor/i, reply: 'The 4P3X Verse™ is designed as a modular AI-assisted platform factory. Instead of building every client system from scratch, the ecosystem uses reusable base architectures. Each base contains proven components — dashboards, PWAs, AI agent layers, onboarding flows, reporting systems, demo/live mode switching, backend-ready logic, and installable PWA behaviour. Client systems are then assembled from the strongest modules across all available bases, enabling faster delivery and lower cost.' },
      { test: /why.*matter|commercial|saas|white.?label|grant.*platform|investor.*case/i, reply: 'The commercial case for 4P3X Verse™ rests on three things: (1) 11 working deployed product directions already proven from one base architecture; (2) five identified base systems capable of generating 55 direct product directions; and (3) cross-base module combination enabling thousands of bespoke client platforms supporting SaaS, white-label, grant-funded, employment, licensing, and partnership opportunities. No revenue or guaranteed returns are claimed — this is an early-stage modular platform ecosystem with demonstrated execution.' },

These include calming breathing exercises, grounding tools, burnout recovery journeys, daily check-ins, progress tracking, and crisis signposting. They are designed to be accessible, structured, and always-available support tools. Any deployment in clinical, safeguarding, or care settings would require appropriate professional oversight, not software alone.' },

The system includes driver acknowledgement before departure, route confidence scoring, and controller dashboard oversight. Critically, the system does not claim to guarantee a legally safe or incident-free route — human responsibility, local knowledge, and controller review remain essential at all times.' },
